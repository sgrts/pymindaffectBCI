    "## For DataScientists: How to analyse multiple datasets\n",
    "So you have gathered a load of data using the [mindaffectBCI](https://github.com/mindaffect/pymindaffectBCI) from yourself on different days, or from a group of people.  Now you want to see if you can tweak the analysis settings to get much better performance in later days.  As you know some machine learning, you know that tweaking the settings on a single dataset will just lead to overfitting.  So you want to try new settings on all the data you have so far to see if your changes generalize to new data.  \n",

    " * How to tweak different settings to see if you can improve the general performance.\n",

    "Note: in addition to using this notebook to analysis data gathered locally, you can perform analysis directly on-line on our [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mindaffect/mindaffectbci) or download this data for local off-line analysis."

As these predictions are used to decide when to stop the trial, they should be as accurate as possible.  Perr(est) represents over all the test trails the systems own estimate of it's chance of being wrong with increasing integeration length.\n",

    "    * **StopErr** : The on-line system will Perr(est) to decide when to stop.  StopErr gives an estimate of how accurate this method of stopping a trial can be.  Due to trial-to-trial variation and accuracy of Perr(est) this can be better tha Perr (as the system can stop early on easy trials, but later on hard trials), or it can be much worse than Perr (if the estimates are very noisy so it stops at the wrong time.)   So this estimate should be as low as possible as early as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **StopThresh** : When making the StopErr results the system estimates a Perr(est) threshold which on-average stops at a given integeration length.  The StopThresh line gives these thresholds.   Ideally, this should be **exactly** equal the StopErr at every time point -- but if Perr(est) is incorrect or highly noisy it can be higher or lower than desired.   This gives a guide to how reliable Perr(est) stopping is for deciding when to stop a trial.\n",
